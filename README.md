HomA is a free and open source framework for building smart homes and connecting them to the internet of things. 
It is designed to provide an entry into the world of home automation while also remaining highly extensible and adaptable for advanced users. 

To facilitate the development of own hardware and software extensions, HomA relies on completely open technologies and standards that are available on many platforms. Hence, it uses the lightweight and open MQTT protocol for both data storage and command transmission.
