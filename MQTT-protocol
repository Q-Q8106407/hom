Homer MQTT-protocol

Device meta attributes for building app interfaces dynamically are available at. These can be set from the webinterface and are not managed by the device itself.
/devices/$uniquedeviceid/meta/name
														 /room

Device controlls are a available at
/devices/$uniquedeviceid/controls

To prevent devices from receiving their own echos, devices must NOT subscribe to the same topics they publish to.
Instead, devices publish values to /devices/$uniquedeviceid/controls/controlname and subscribe to value updates by external interface at /devices/$uniquedeviceid/controls/controlname/on (e.g. by subscribing to /devices/$uniquedeviceid/controls/+/on)
	
For each control, the type has to be published at 
/devices/$uniquedeviceid/controls/power/type = {"switch", "range", "text"}


Sensor values can be published to 
/devices/$uniquedeviceid/controls/$sensorname 

with a type published as "text"
/devices/$uniquedeviceid/controls/$sensorname/type = text
